===== Inventory Management System - How to Run =====

Quick Start:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run this command:
   C:/Users/mehul/miniconda3/Scripts/activate streamlit_app && streamlit run app.py

If the above doesn't work, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check Available Conda Environments:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Run: C:/Users/mehul/miniconda3/Scripts/activate
   - Run: conda env list
   - Look for 'streamlit_app' in the list

2. If Streamlit Not Found:
   a) Activate the correct environment:
      C:/Users/mehul/miniconda3/Scripts/activate streamlit_app
   
   b) Install required packages:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Common Issues:
   - If Streamlit asks which environment to use, select 'streamlit_app'
   - Make sure to check "Remember my selection" when prompted
   - Always run Streamlit from the conda environment, not system Python

4. File Structure:
   - app.py: Main application file
   - requirements.txt: Required Python packages
   - Inventorydata.xlsx: Data file

Note: Your Streamlit app is installed in the 'streamlit_app' conda environment. Always use this environment to run the application.
